Effective communication is the foundation of patient care. When a patient feels heard, safe and respected, they are more likely to share vital information.

### Key Communication Principles:

1. **Polite Greeting and Introduction**
   Always begin with a smile and clear introduction:
   > "Hello, my name is Sarah, I\'m one of the nurses here today."

2. **Body Language Matters**
   - Sit at eye level with the patient
   - Avoid crossing arms or looking distracted
   - Maintain comfortable eye contact

3. **Active Listening**
   - Nod to show understanding
   - Use short verbal affirmations like "I see", "Go on"
   - Don’t interrupt — let the patient speak freely first

4. **Empathy and Reassurance**
   Patients may be anxious, scared, or frustrated. Acknowledge this:
   > "I can see you\'re feeling overwhelmed. You\'re in safe hands now."

5. **Simple and Clear Language**
   Avoid medical jargon. Use plain English and short sentences.
   > Say: "I’m going to take your blood pressure now"
   > Avoid: "I\'ll perform a sphygmomanometric reading"

6. **Check Understanding**
   Ask:
   > "Does that make sense?"  
   > "Would you like me to explain that again?"

### Bonus Tips:
- Use the patient\'s name during the interaction
- Pause and give them time to respond
- Avoid multitasking during conversations

### Why It Matters:
Poor communication is a common reason for complaints and misdiagnoses. Mastering these basics can improve patient outcomes and trust — and they’re often assessed during the OSCE.
