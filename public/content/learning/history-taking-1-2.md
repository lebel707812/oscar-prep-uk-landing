Taking a patient’s history is one of the most fundamental — and most frequently tested — skills in the OSCE. A structured and professional approach helps ensure no important detail is missed.

### 🧩 Standard History-Taking Framework

Follow this logical order to guide the conversation:

1. **Introduce Yourself and Gain Consent**
   > "Hello, I’m [Your Name], one of the nurses. I’d like to ask you a few questions to understand what’s brought you in today. Is that alright?"

2. **Chief Complaint**
   - Start with an open question:  
     > "Can you tell me what brought you here today?"
   - Let the patient speak freely at first. Don’t interrupt.

3. **History of Presenting Complaint (HPC)**
   - Use open and closed questions to explore:
     - Onset: "When did it start?"
     - Location: "Where exactly do you feel it?"
     - Duration: "Is it constant or does it come and go?"
     - Severity: "How bad is it, from 0 to 10?"
     - Aggravating/relieving factors: "What makes it better or worse?"
     - Associated symptoms: "Have you noticed anything else?"

4. **Past Medical History (PMH)**
   > "Have you had any medical problems in the past? Any surgeries or hospital stays?"

5. **Medication History**
   > "Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter or herbal remedies?"

6. **Allergies**
   > "Do you have any known allergies or reactions to medication?"

7. **Family History**
   > "Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?"

8. **Social History**
   Ask about:
   - Smoking
   - Alcohol use
   - Occupation
   - Living situation
   - Support system

9. **Review of Systems**
   > "Have you had any other symptoms recently, such as headaches, weight loss, or fatigue?"

10. **Summarise and Confirm**
   Recap what the patient has told you:
   > "Just to confirm, you've been feeling chest pain for two days, especially when walking, and it improves with rest. Is that correct?"

### 🧠 Tips for Beginners

- **Use open-ended questions first**, then narrow down.
- Avoid medical jargon — always check for understanding.
- Take notes efficiently, but **maintain eye contact** regularly.
- Show empathy, even during structured questioning.

> 🩺 In OSCE exams, candidates often lose marks by missing key steps or failing to summarise. Practise saying it aloud in a real flow.
