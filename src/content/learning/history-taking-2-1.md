Pain is a common presenting complaint in clinical practice — and one you’ll often encounter in the OSCE. The **SOCRATES** framework provides a structured way to explore pain in detail, helping identify its cause and severity.

### 🧠 What is SOCRATES?

Each letter stands for a key aspect of pain assessment:

1. **S – Site**  
   > "Can you point to exactly where it hurts?"

   Identify the **location**. Is it localised or diffuse?

2. **O – Onset**  
   > "When did the pain start?"  
   > "Did it come on suddenly or gradually?"

   Determine **timing** and **context**.

3. **C – Character**  
   > "Can you describe what the pain feels like?"

   Is it:
   - Sharp
   - Dull
   - Burning
   - Throbbing
   - Crushing

4. **R – Radiation**  
   > "Does the pain spread anywhere else?"

   Important for conditions like **cardiac pain**, which may radiate to arm, jaw or back.

5. **A – Associated Symptoms**  
   > "Have you noticed any other symptoms with the pain?"

   For example:
   - Nausea
   - Sweating
   - Fever
   - Shortness of breath

6. **T – Time Course**  
   > "Has the pain been constant or does it come and go?"

   Understand **pattern** and **progression**.

7. **E – Exacerbating/Relieving Factors**  
   > "Is there anything that makes the pain better or worse?"

   Common examples:
   - Movement
   - Eating
   - Rest
   - Position

8. **S – Severity**  
   > "On a scale from 0 to 10, how bad is the pain?"

   This provides a **quantitative** assessment to monitor changes.

### 🎯 Example in Practice

**Scenario:**  
Patient says: “I’ve had a dull ache in my lower back for three days.”

**Your response using SOCRATES:**

- Site: "Is the pain limited to your lower back or does it move elsewhere?"
- Onset: "Did it start suddenly or gradually?"
- Character: "Is it a sharp stabbing pain or more like a dull ache?"
- Radiation: "Does it spread to your legs or buttocks?"
- Associations: "Any tingling, numbness, or weakness?"
- Time: "Is it constant or does it come and go?"
- Exacerbating/Relieving: "What makes it worse or better?"
- Severity: "How bad is it right now, from 0 to 10?"

### 🩺 Why This Matters in the OSCE

In the OSCE, you’ll be expected to **explore pain comprehensively**, especially in stations related to:
- Chest pain
- Abdominal pain
- Musculoskeletal injuries
- Post-operative care

You must **demonstrate structure, empathy and clinical reasoning** — not just ask questions robotically.

### 🔍 Quick Tip:
Always **summarise the pain** at the end:
> "So you’ve had a dull, constant pain in your lower back for 3 days, which worsens when walking and improves with rest, and you rate it as a 6 out of 10 — is that correct?"

This shows organisation and patient-centred care.
