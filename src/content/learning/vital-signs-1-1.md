# 1.1 Temperature, Pulse, and Respiration

This section covers the fundamental principles and techniques for assessing body temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate. Understanding these core vital signs is crucial for any healthcare professional to monitor a patient\'s physiological status and detect early signs of deterioration.

## Temperature

Body temperature is a measure of the body\'s ability to generate and dissipate heat. Normal body temperature is typically around 37°C (98.6°F), but it can vary depending on the individual, time of day, and measurement site.

### Measurement Sites:

*   **Oral:** Convenient and common, but can be affected by recent food/drink.
*   **Axillary:** Less accurate, often used for infants or uncooperative patients.
*   **Rectal:** Most accurate, but invasive.
*   **Tympanic (Ear):** Quick and easy, but technique-dependent.
*   **Temporal (Forehead):** Non-invasive, good for screening.

### Clinical Significance:

*   **Fever (Pyrexia):** Elevated temperature, often indicates infection or inflammation.
*   **Hypothermia:** Abnormally low temperature, can be caused by exposure to cold or certain medical conditions.

## Pulse

The pulse is the rhythmic throbbing of arteries produced by the regular contractions of the heart. It reflects the heart rate and rhythm.

### Common Pulse Sites:

*   **Radial:** Most common site, located on the thumb side of the wrist.
*   **Carotid:** Used in emergencies to assess circulation to the brain.
*   **Brachial:** Used for blood pressure measurement and in infants.
*   **Femoral:** Located in the groin, used in emergencies.

### Assessment:

*   **Rate:** Number of beats per minute (normal adult range: 60-100 bpm).
*   **Rhythm:** Regular or irregular.
*   **Strength:** Bounding, strong, weak, or thready.

## Respiration

Respiration is the process of taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. It involves both inspiration (inhalation) and expiration (exhalation).

### Assessment:

*   **Rate:** Number of breaths per minute (normal adult range: 12-20 breaths/min).
*   **Rhythm:** Regular or irregular.
*   **Depth:** Shallow, normal, or deep.
*   **Character:** Effortless or labored.
